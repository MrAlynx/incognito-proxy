# Incognito Proxy 

This is a simple Chrome extension for configuring proxy settings. Its namesake feature is the ability to configure *different* settings for regular windows and incognito windows.

The code is based on `proxy_configuration` from [chrome-extensions-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/).
